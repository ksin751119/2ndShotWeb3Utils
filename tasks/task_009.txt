# Task ID: 9
# Title: Error Handling Enhancement and UI Polish
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve error handling system and refine the user interface
# Details:
Enhance the error handling system across all tools. Implement user-friendly error messages that explain issues clearly. Add input validation improvements with real-time feedback. Polish UI elements for consistency across all tools. Ensure responsive design works well on all screen sizes. Refine copy functionality notifications. Implement loading states for operations that might take time.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct usability testing across all tools. Verify error messages are clear and helpful. Test responsive behavior on various devices. Ensure consistent UI experience throughout the application.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized error handling system with user-friendly error messages across all tools
### Details:
1. Create a centralized error handling service that can be used across all tools
2. Define error categories (network errors, validation errors, system errors, etc.)
3. Implement standardized error message templates for each category
4. Add context-specific error messages that explain the issue and suggest solutions
5. Create error logging functionality to track issues
6. Implement graceful fallbacks for critical operations
7. Test error handling with various failure scenarios
8. Ensure errors are displayed in a consistent UI component

Testing approach: Create unit tests for the error handling service with mock error scenarios. Manually test by triggering errors in different parts of the application.

## 2. Add Input Validation with Real-time Feedback [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Enhance form inputs with validation and real-time feedback to prevent errors before submission
### Details:
1. Identify all input fields across the application that require validation
2. Define validation rules for each input type (text, numbers, emails, etc.)
3. Implement client-side validation logic that runs in real-time as users type
4. Create visual indicators for valid/invalid inputs (green/red borders, icons)
5. Add helpful tooltip messages that explain validation requirements
6. Ensure validation messages are clear and actionable
7. Implement debounce functionality to prevent validation running on every keystroke
8. Connect validation errors to the centralized error handling system

Testing approach: Create unit tests for validation rules. Test edge cases with various input combinations. Perform usability testing to ensure feedback is helpful and not annoying.

## 3. Polish UI Elements and Implement Loading States [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Refine UI for consistency across all tools and add loading states for operations
### Details:
1. Audit all UI components for visual consistency (colors, spacing, typography)
2. Create a design system document defining UI standards
3. Implement loading spinners/skeletons for operations that take time
4. Add transition animations between loading and loaded states
5. Refine copy functionality with clear success/failure notifications
6. Test responsive design on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
7. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus states
8. Implement consistent error state styling that integrates with the error handling system
9. Add subtle animations for user interactions (button clicks, form submissions)

Testing approach: Create a visual regression testing suite. Test on multiple devices and screen sizes. Perform usability testing to ensure loading states provide appropriate feedback.
