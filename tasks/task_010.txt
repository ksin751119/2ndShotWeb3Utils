# Task ID: 10
# Title: Testing, Optimization and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing, optimize performance, and document the application
# Details:
Implement unit tests for core functionality. Perform cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Optimize performance, especially for big number operations. Implement code splitting for better load times. Add helpful tooltips and instructions for each tool. Create user documentation explaining each tool's purpose and usage. Perform final review of all features against PRD requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Run comprehensive test suite across all components. Measure and verify performance metrics. Test in multiple browsers and devices. Conduct final user acceptance testing against the PRD requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and execute unit tests for core functionality and perform cross-browser compatibility testing
### Details:
1. Set up a testing framework (Jest or similar) for the application
2. Write unit tests for all core calculator functions (basic operations, scientific functions, number base conversions)
3. Create integration tests for the UI components and their interactions
4. Implement automated cross-browser testing using tools like Selenium or Cypress
5. Test the application on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
6. Document all discovered bugs and issues in a tracking system
7. Fix identified issues and verify fixes with regression testing
8. Create a test report summarizing coverage and results

Testing approach: Use a combination of automated tests for core functionality and manual testing for UI/UX verification. Ensure at least 80% code coverage for critical calculation functions.

## 2. Optimize Application Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Improve application performance focusing on big number operations and implement code splitting for better load times
### Details:
1. Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks, especially in big number operations
2. Optimize the big number calculation algorithms by implementing caching or more efficient methods
3. Implement code splitting to separate the application into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand
4. Configure webpack (or similar bundler) to create separate bundles for each calculator mode
5. Implement lazy loading for non-essential components and features
6. Add loading indicators for async operations
7. Optimize asset loading (CSS, images) with proper caching strategies
8. Measure and document performance improvements with before/after metrics

Testing approach: Use Lighthouse or similar tools to measure performance metrics before and after optimization. Create performance tests for big number operations with large inputs to verify improvements.

## 3. Create Documentation and Final Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Add user-facing documentation, tooltips, and perform final review against requirements
### Details:
1. Add contextual tooltips to all calculator buttons and functions explaining their purpose
2. Create a comprehensive user guide explaining each calculator mode and its features
3. Implement an in-app help section with usage instructions and examples
4. Document keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
5. Create developer documentation including architecture overview and maintenance guidelines
6. Review the entire application against the PRD requirements to ensure all features are implemented correctly
7. Conduct a final usability review to identify any UX improvements
8. Update the README.md with setup instructions, features list, and screenshots

Testing approach: Conduct user testing with the documentation to ensure clarity and completeness. Create a requirements traceability matrix to verify all PRD items are implemented and documented.
