# Task ID: 4
# Title: Number Tools - Unit Converter Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Ethereum unit converter tool
# Details:
Implement the Unit Converter tool that supports Ethereum unit conversions (Wei, Gwei, Ether, etc.) similar to Etherscan. Use ethers.js utilities for accurate conversions. Create a form interface with input field, unit selection dropdowns, and convert button. Implement validation for numeric inputs and handle large numbers properly using BigNumber from ethers.js. Add copy functionality for results.

# Test Strategy:
Test conversion accuracy with various input values. Verify handling of very large and very small numbers. Test input validation and error handling for invalid inputs.
