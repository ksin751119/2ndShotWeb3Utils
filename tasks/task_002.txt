# Task ID: 2
# Title: Core Layout and Navigation Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main layout structure with left-side navigation and black/white theme
# Details:
Create a responsive layout component with a fixed left-side navigation bar. Implement the black and white color scheme (70% white, 30% black) using CSS variables for theming. Design navigation links for all tool categories (Number Tools, Time Tools, Address Tools, Dev Tools). Implement basic routing using React Router. Create placeholder pages for each tool to be developed later.

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Verify navigation links correctly route to placeholder pages. Ensure the layout adheres to the specified color scheme.
